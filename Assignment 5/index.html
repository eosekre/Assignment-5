            <h1>MY SCHOOL</h1>
<P>
    <h2>ABURI GIRLS' </h2><br>
    <p> Aburi Girls' is the name of my school</p>
    It is in Ghana which is located on the Aburi Mountain.
    My school is the first school you would locate on the Aburi Mountian.
    <p>My school has a colorful compound which encourages others to bring their children.</p>
    It is a very disciplined school and all student who have been under Aburi Girls' training can testify.
    It is a very famous school, well-known for their intelligence and how they train their students.
    Our brother school is Presec-legon, which is also a very good boys school, it is also an 'A' school just like Aburi Girls'
    My school has well-qualifed teachers, who make class more interactive and fun.
    My school  has trained about 10,000 students and most of them are well-off.
    My school has lots of facilities such as; Basketball pitches,Canteens with the best meals and chef etc.
    My school has won Inter-schools Maths and Science Quizzes which made us more popular around the 16 regions in Ghana and even nation-wide.
    Although my school is an all-girls school the teacher still teach us that we are all equal;Boys and Girls.
We have a serene environment for effective teaching and learning.
Every day in Aburi Girls' is a new memory to cherish. In Aburi, you are secured. Aburi Girls' is like a second home to others and me especially.
All students are kind and understanding. Aburi teachs us-the students a lot of things especially to be independent.
Since my school is on the hill, we have fresh air every time.Most of the girls in Aburi have one dream and that is to make their parents proud and I also have the exact dream.
Aburi keeps breaks their own records each year. Most of the girls in Ghana wish to attend Aburi Girls.
In my school, no form of nonsense is toleranted.
Apart from education, Aburi has other ways of entertaining students.
Aburi teachs discipline,tolerance,respect, haardwork and especially independence.
As a school, our mission is to make Ghana famous and to promote girl-child education.
<p>My school is very beautiful.</p>I love my school because it is very peaceful. The school brings a form of excitement.
It is one of the best-girls schools in Ghana. I wish to be a prefect someday and be the face of my school without forgetting my mission to make my parents PROUD
